In this project, i have created a dynamic web page using ReactJS, divided into three crucial components: Header, Body Section, and Footer Section. i have utilized JSX (JavaScript XML) to define the structure of these components and follow best practices by using Create React App for project setup.

#### Body Section Component
+ The Body Section is the central part of our web page, housing the primary content.

+ This section is where you can showcase the core information or features of your website.
#### Footer Section Component:
+ The Footer Section is the bottommost part of our web page.
